### 46 Simple Python exercises

Solutions to the 46 Simple Python Exercises.
This list of exercises comprises logical operators, loops, input and output, regular expressions and more in order for people to have a basic overview of the language.
They might not be the best solutions (of course, I'm just learning python) but I'd be glad to pull your requests.

### Contributing
If you are also learning python and know how to use GitHub, you can clone this repo, add your solution to one or more of the files, add it as a comment in the python file with your name and username at the top. There is an example in each file to show you how to contribute. So that way, there will be multiple solutions for each exercise, but only mine will not be commented :)

This will be a helpful repo for people learning python using these 46 Simple Python Exercises provided by Torbj√∂rn Lager (torbjorn.lager@ling.gu.se) over [there](http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/python_exercises.html).
And with your contributions, they will be able to check multiple ways to solve one exercise.

Enjoy.
