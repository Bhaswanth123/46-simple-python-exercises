### [46 Simple Python exercises](http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/python_exercises.html)

This list of exercises comprises logical operators, loops, input and output, regular expressions and more in order for people to have a basic overview of the language.

They might not be the best solutions, but I'd be glad to pull your requests.

This repository contains solutions to all 46 exercises I have solved. They're intended as a last resort in case you've tried very hard to solve a problem but you just haven't been able to figure it out.

I made sure to comment the hardest ones, or the ones that gave me some trouble.

Enjoy.
